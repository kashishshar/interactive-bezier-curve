Interactive Bézier Curve with Physics

This project implements a cubic Bézier curve that behaves like a rope using
spring-damping physics and real-time mouse input.
Features
- Manual cubic Bézier curve math
- Tangent visualization using derivatives
- Spring-based motion for control points
- Real-time interaction at 60 FPS
- No external libraries
- 
How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Move the mouse to interact with the curve
